# MachineLearning-Basics
These are basic implementation of most common machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Clustering, Neural Networks and SVM etc in OCTAVE.
This is taken from the machine learning course offered by Stanford on Coursera.
Every folder has a pdf file explaining the objective of the excerise and the code files have the solution implemented.
